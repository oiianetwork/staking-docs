# Load Keys to Node

## For Reth-Lighthouse Template

### Copy Key File

In the `mainnet-reth-lighthouse` folder, you will see an empty `validator_keys` folder. Copy your `keystore-` file generated by the CLI tool to it. Your folder tree should look like this:

```
mainnet-reth-lighthouse
├── validator_keys
│   ├── keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1716876797.json
```

### Generate key secrects file

Run this script with your keystore file's password to generate a secrets file, so your validator can import your keys:

```bash
python3 lighthouseSecrets.py validator_keys/ 12345678
```

If no errors are shown after this command, you will see a file generated in the `validator_keys_secrets` folder:
```
validator_keys_secrets/
└── 0xb8d4524f48828ff1b878918c2b403a9d693ffd078901b6b41b28fd76fed8abda12ec2e8bafe3f9b9b80322c238a7412b
```

The filename is the public key in your keystore file, and the file content is your password:

```vash
mainnet-reth-lighthouse# cat validator_keys_secrets/0xb8d4524f48828ff1b878918c2b403a9d693ffd078901b6b41b28fd76fed8abda12ec2e8bafe3f9b9b80322c238a7412b 
12345678
```

:::note

The script is just a helper to generate the secrets file; you can modify it directly.

### Restart node

Stop your node first:

```
./down.sh
```

Then start your node:

```
./start.sh
```

Check the node status now:

```
./status.sh
```

You will get this output:

```

```

The important part is `Validator Status`, which shows the keys you have loaded.
