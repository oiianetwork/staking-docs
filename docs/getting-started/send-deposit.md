# Send Deposit

Use your `deposit_data-` file generated earlier, and follow this guide to send your deposit request on-chain:

- https://dora.oiia.network/validators/deposits/submit


And you can check your validator's deposit status in this page:

- https://dora.oiia.network/validators

You just need to wait for 1 day if there are no other pending validators; your validator will become active.
